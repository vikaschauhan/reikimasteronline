                            KARMA HEALING
                    </h1>
                    <p class="bd-lead">
                            The most powerful healing system which heals your karma by accessing your past life. It is a powerful soul transformation technique which has been conceptualised to empower us to be able to directly connect and communicate with our sub-conscious or the purest form of our energy that is still rooted in being a spark of pure white light. The idea is to bring about a shift by clearing the negative energy at the sub-conscious level that is accumulated through past life karmic memories / thought patterns & emotions to be able to free this moment of their impact & hence experience empowerment in this moment. 

यह एक ऐसी चिकित्सा प्रणाली है जो हमारे पिछले जन्म तक पहुँच कर हमारे कर्मों की चिकित्सा कर  सकती है। यह आत्मा के परिवर्तन की एक अत्यंत शक्तिशाली प्रणाली है जिसको हमारे अवचेतन मन में छिपी हुई असीम ऊर्जा के संपर्क में लाकर ऐवम उसके साथ संवाद स्थापित करके छिपे हुए कर्मो की जड़ तक पहुंच कर ठीक किया जाता है।
हमारे मन के अवचेतन में सभी जन्मो के संस्कार छिपे हुए होते हैं चाहे वो अच्छे हों या बुरे हों। इन कर्मो के संस्कारों के कारण ही हम समय समय पर उनके फल को भोगते हैं। यह अच्छी और बुरी यादों के रूप में भी होती हैं या हमारे सोचने का सही और गलत तरीका और हमारे अंदर के अच्छे और बुरे भाव भी इनके प्रभाव के कारण ही होते है जिसको हम हीलिंग के माध्यम से सही कर सकते हैं। और वर्तमान समय में उसके प्रभाव को कम करके उससे मुक्ति का अनुभव कर सकते हैं और अपने वर्तमान जीवन को सुखी बना सकते हैं।


The idea behind this revolutionary technique is that on an average each person creates about 60,000 thoughts each day. Each time we have an experience that is not as per our expectations, it creates a series of thoughts which in turn build beliefs like “I am not good enough”, “I don’t trust them”, “I don’t deserve love”, “God didn’t help me”, “I didn’t do anything wrong but I got punishment”, “I need to suffer to get everything”, “It is unsafe to love”, “Nobody understands me” etc. Now this list is very long and each one of us has hundreds of those negative beliefs for ourselves as well as others. When our souls came into existence, we came with the pure, original definitions of emotions and through our experiences over so many lives, they got distorted over and over. Through KH, the therapist can be guided to which emotions / beliefs are causing blockages in a client’s life and those aspects can be addressed to remove the negative charge and restore the emotions to their original definitions. 


KH has the power to format the hard disk of our souls and make it fresh and new for manifestation. When there are no past memories or beliefs blocking our experience of now, the tomorrow that is to come will be new and exactly how we want it to be. It has the ability to unclutter our entire existence and that is the light in which we feel so much closer to the creator and our purpose for this life. 


Ideally, 7 sessions of KH have the ability to transform all basic emotions of each individual to initiate transformation in their life. Post that, the ball is set to roll and then it’s their inner guidance that drives them to enhance their connection with themselves or be happy in their newly found state of being. 


It is possible to address the following life situations through KH.




Relationship Issues
Physical Ailments
Fears & Phobias
Spiritual Growth
Addictive Behaviour
Lack of Confidence
Depression
Financial problems
Looking for Life Purpose
Problems at work, etc.
Suicidal Tendecies


And even dark secrets of your life and your soul which you never wants to reveal with anyone. We have supressed ourselves in so many ways and in such a way that we are now not able to understand our own supression and life brings so many types of dark shames and secrets which has the power on our conscious life and limits  us to enjoy it fully. It is powerful tool to resolve internal conflicts and then begin the journey of manifestation. It makes one equipped to be aware of their thoughts and the power those thoughts carry in creating the life they have always wanted to live. 

In terms of methodology, KH is done by the therapist holding your hand while you sit on a chair and close your eyes. once the therapist makes a connection with your energies, he/she has the ability to converse with your sub-conscious mind and discover whatever is bothering it & heal it. It DOES NOT involve hypnosis like Past Life Regression(PLR) does and is extremely useful for people who fear their conscious / analytical minds might interfare in them resolving their concerns at a deeper level. </p>
