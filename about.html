                            Records

                    <div class="text-paragraph">
                        <p>I started my Reiki 1st degree in 1999 and then i frequently used reiki
                            energy to heal my body and mind and i felt much peace in my mind so when i got chance to
                            learn 2nd degree after six months, i immediately went for it and after that i did my reiki
                            practice with a homeopathic doctor in kathmandu for almost 1 year and i treated many
                            patients through direct and distance reiki healing. Then i felt a deep urge to do mastership
                            in it.so i finally became Reiki Master in 2002 and i opened Reiki Training Center in my home
                            at kathmandu and began to teach people in this beautiful system. But i had to left Nepal for
                            some personal reasons and i came to india and from 2014, I again started teaching reiki
                            healing system on one to one basis. The Journey became much interesting and joyful when i
                            started teaching reiki to people all over the world through distance attunement and it is
                            always more energetic experience then giving the attunement in person.
                            <p>In 2015, I got the blessings of my spiritual masters and existence itself and i became a
                                divine healer and since then, my healing energies are growing on regular basis.</p>
                            ​<p>From 07 March 2016, On the Auspicious Day of Mahashivratri, I started doing one day
                                complete silence on weekly basis to raise my consciousness and increase in healing
                                energies
                                so that i can really help people from all over the world. </p>
                            <p>From 20 June 2016, I started Past Life Karma Healing which increased my level of
                                understanding and consciousness at a very deep level and also the effects of healing
                                were
                                increased many folds.</p>

                            <p>From 26 March 2017, I started teaching Past Life Karma Healing and my first student is my
                                wife, who is very helpful in my work.</p>

                            <p>I have much interest in Silence and the interest grows when i first did 21 days complete
                                Silence in Osho Tapoban, Kathmandu which is 6 km far from the city and surrounded by a
                                very
                                big and intense forest in 1998. After that my spiritual journey started growing and i
                                met
                                many enlightened spiritual masters, and it also helped me in my healing work. Now a
                                days, i
                                usually live my whole day speaking very little.</p>

                            <p>From 21 April 2018, i started Reading of Akashic Records, which i learnt from an Indian
                                Master who lives in Canada and also i got help from World Renowned Matser's Journal and
                                some
                                other masters.</p>

                            <p>I am not a fully enlightened master but only a simple human being who is walking alone on
                                his spiritual path and wants to help others too. I have been gifted some healing powers
                                and
                                also intuitive senses which makes me able to understand many things which normal human
                                being
                                normally don't have. These abilities can be developed through regular practice of
                                meditation. I don't believe in making any kind of emotional or mental attachment with
                                anybody so i don't create and guru shishya type relationship. I simply do it to earn my
                                living. I can do it from any distance. If you want guidance on any specific subject,
                                then
                                you can contact me.
                                Thank you</p>

                        <p>Health is the greatest treasure. In this well known dictum lies the irrefutable truth
                            that health is one of the greatest blessings we can possess. It is necessary in every stage
                            of life.
                            All human beings desire to live comfortably with all their vital needs satisfied such as
                            food,
                            housing, clothing, self realization and the like. Yet all these things become accessible if
                            one has
                            good health. Modern medicine has managed to cure many illnesses in modern times in the same
                            way;
                            Reiki can also cure many of these illnesses. Some cases where medicine has failed to find a
                            cure can
                            be healed through Reiki treatments. Even though it is a very ancient method, Reiki has
                            earned a
                            great popularity in many countries and is now being used across the globe.Anyone can take a
                            bath in
                            the holy river Ganga and in the same way; anyone of any religion or any community can learn
                            or
                            receive Reiki. It is like a highway that is open to all. In this way, everyone has an equal
                            right to
                            access a natural source of knowledge. May the eternal & infinite Light of Reiki shine over
                            us
                            forever.</p>
