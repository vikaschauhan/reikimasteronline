                            Money Reiki Healing
                    </h1>
                    <p class="bd-lead">Money Reiki helps heal the negative or limiting energies that people collect about money and gently yet powerfully aligns one’s own energy with that of money, wealth and abundance.

                            Many of us have conflicting beliefs and energy about money, prosperity and abundance. We aspire to live well and to provide
                            
                            for our families, our employees, our animals and our communities. However, society and perhaps our own family has [international money all currencies]  fostered beliefs that money is bad or that we are not worthy of having plenty.
                            
                            
                            ​Money Reiki Healing deals specifically with Universal money energy, helping you receive, spend and manage money more consciously and efficiently for the highest good of all. Money Reiki Healing Energy helps raise the consciousness of money on
                            
                            the planet by creating global energy shifts surrounding money. Money Reiki Healing is a form of distance energy healing and
                            
                            can be done for anyone no matter where they are in the world.
                            
                            
                            ​Money Reiki is not meant to be used to hit the lottery or for “get-rich-quick” schemes, although it’s perfectly fine for you to ask
                            
                            to have money appear unexpectedly. Deep Money Healing happens with every energy healing session a person receives and
                            
                            the speed of individual results depends on how blocked each person’s money energy is. The best results come from having the
                            
                            proper intention so that you can start to align with the flow of money. I will help you clear out ineffective negative energies so
                            
                            you can naturally attract more money into your life.
                            
                            
                            Money Reiki healing is used for improving overall financial & business conditions. In this healing, we do healing two times in a
                            
                            day for your business (mostly). Regular use of these healing can improve your business turnover, attract new customers and maximizes your profits. </p>

                            Money Reiki Healing
                            
                            
                            ​Money Reiki is a system that is here to help you and the planet with money issues. It is about the Spiritual Energy of Money.
                            
                            When you are attuned to the Spiritual Energy of Money, you become part of a movement to increase the vibration of money around the world to one that is more generous, cooperative, and egalitarian. You align yourself with the intention that you can and will earn money with integrity by following your highest path.
                            
                            When you use money reiki you remove energetic blocks that cause you to sabotage yourself with money. If your bank account is frequently overdrawn, if you tend to have late fees on your bills, or if you have other financial management problems, this attunement should help. You become more capable of manifesting money in your life.
                            
                            Money Reiki is not a “get-rich-quick” scheme. It is here to help transform the energy of money on the planet in addition to helping you personally. The big difference between Money Reiki philosophy and most prosperity programs is the acknowledgement that collective negative thought forms and energies surrounding money also need to be cleared and healed. If you are excited about the idea of helping everyone become more prosperous then this attunement course is for you!
                            
                            Money Reiki Practitioner Course (Level I)
                            In this course you will learn how to use Money Reiki energies, including performing treatments, giving financial blessings, and creating a money magnet.
                            
                            Money Reiki Master Course (Level II)
                            This course delves deeper into Money Reiki – you will get three new symbols and more tools to use Money Reiki, as well as the Master level attunement and ability to attune others to these energies.
                            
                            Money Reiki works to help you manifest your life purpose on this planet, so this course also covers the issues that may come up for you as you make these shifts, and how to ride through the rough spots as your life gets adjusted to support your purpose.
                            
                            Money Reiki Grand Master Course (Level III)

                            Please note that all attunements for Money Reiki are being offered here via chi ball.
